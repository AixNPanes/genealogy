Provides simple interfaces to main gedcom creation operations.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The gedcom package provides a number of wrappers to simplify the creation of
Gedcom 6.0 elements.  The functionality provided by jaxb out of the box is at
times cumbersome to use.  Developers are encouraged to only use the gedcom classes
to create their gedcom files, and if they find a method wanting, they are encouraged
to add it.  Note that many of the jaxb provided methods, as they are inherited
by their gedcom subclasses, may be used directly.  For example.
<PRE>

		// Product
		Product prod = new Product(); // wrapper from gedcom package
		prod.setName("SourceForge createGedcom"); // wrapper method
		prod.setProductId("createGedcom"); // jaxb inherited method
		prod.setVersion("1.0"); // jaxb inherited method

</PRE>

The other thing the gedcom package provides for is maintaining an in-memory database
of ContactRec, FamilyRec, GroupRec, IndividualRec, and SourceRec objects.  This
facility is provided to assist developers in linking objects.  For example, after
adding all the indivuals to the GEDCOM, you will want to add those individuals to
families and events.  IndividualRec objects can be retrieved by id from the IndividualRec
class as follows.

<PRE>

		FamilyRec familyRec = new FamilyRec(fam.getId());
		EventRec eventRec = new EventRec(fam.getId(), EventRec.VitalType.marriage);

		if (fam.getHusband() != null) {
			IndividualRec indi = IndividualRec.getRecord(fam.getHusbandId())));
			familyRec.setHusband(indi);
			eventRec.addParticipant(indi, EventRec.Role.husband);
		}

</PRE>
