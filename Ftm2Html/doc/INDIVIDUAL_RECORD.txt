The individual record is a compilation of facts, known or discovered, about 
an individual.  Sometimes these facts are from different sources.  This form 
allows documentation of the source where each of the facts were discovered.

The normal lineage links are shown through the use of pointers from the 
individual to a family through either the FAMC tag or the FAMS tag.  The FAMC 
tag provides a pointer to a family where this person is a child.  The FAMS tag 
provides a pointer to a family where this person is a spouse or parent.  
The <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> (see page 33) structure contains a FAMC pointer 
which is required to show any child to parent linkage for pedigree navigation.  
The <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> structure also indicates whether the pedigree link 
represents a birth lineage, an adoption lineage, or a sealing lineage.

Linkage between a child and the family they belonged to at the time of an event 
can also optionally be shown by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the appropriate 
event.  For example, a FAMC pointer subordinate to an adoption event would show 
which family adopted this individual. Biological parent or parents can be 
indicated by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the birth event. The FAMC tag 
can also optionally be used subordinate to an ADOPtion, or BIRTh event to 
differentiate which set of parents were related by adoption, sealing, or birth.

Other associations or relationships are represented by the ASSOciation tag.  
The person's relation or association is the person being pointed to. The 
association or relationship is stated by the value on the subordinate RELA line.   
For example:

0 @I1@ INDI
	1 NAME Fred/Jones/
	1 ASSO @I2@
		2 RELA Godfather
