The FAMily record is used to record marriages, common law marriages, and 
family unions caused by two people becoming the parents of a child. There can 
be no more than one HUSB/father and one WIFE/mother listed in each FAM_RECORD. 
If, for example, a man participated in more than one family union, then he 
would appear in more than one FAM_RECORD. The family record structure assumes 
that the HUSB/father is male and WIFE/mother is female.

The preferred order of the CHILdren pointers within a FAMily structure is 
chronological by birth.
