	+1 DATE <CHANGE_DATE>												{1:1}

	+1 <<NOTE_STRUCTURE>>												{0:M} 

The change date is intended to only record the last change to a record.  
Some systems may want to manage the change process with more detail, but it is 
sufficient for GEDCOM purposes to indicate the last time that a record was 
modified.
