The data provided in the <<SOURCE_CITATION>> structure is source-related
information specific to the data being cited. (See GEDCOM examples starting 
on page 61.) Systems that do not use SOURCE_RECORDS must use the second SOURce 
citation structure option.  When systems which support SOURCE_RECORD structures 
encounter source citations which do not contain pointers to source records, 
that system will need to create a SOURCE_RECORD and store the 
<SOURCE_DESCRIPTION> information found in the non-structured source citation 
in either the title area of that SOURCE_RECORD, or if the title field is not 
large enough, place a "(See Notes)" text in the title area, and place the 
unstructured source description in the source record's note field.

The information intended to be placed in the citation structure includes:

! A pointer to the SOURCE_RECORD, which contains a more general description 
	of the source.
! Information, such as a page number, on how to find the cited data within 
	the source. 
! Actual text from the source that was used in making assertions, for 
	example a date phrase as actually recorded or an applicable sentence 
	from a letter, would be appropriate.
! Data that allows an assessment of the relative value of one source over 
	another for making the recorded assertions (primary or secondary source, 
	etc.).  Data needed for this assessment is how much time from the asserted 
	fact and when the source event was recorded, what type of event was cited, 
	and what was the role of this person in the cited event.
- Date when the entry was recorded in source document, ".SOUR.DATA.DATE." 
- Event that initiated the recording, ".SOUR.EVEN." 
- Role of this person in the event, ".SOUR.EVEN.ROLE".
