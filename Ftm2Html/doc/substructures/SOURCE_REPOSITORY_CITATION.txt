This structure is used within a source record to point to a name and address 
record of the holder of the source document.  Formal and informal repository 
name and addresses are stored in the REPOSITORY_RECORD.  Informal repositories 
include owner's of an unpublished work or of a rare published source, or a 
keeper of personal collections. An example would be the owner of a family 
Bible containing unpublished family genealogical entries. More formal 
repositories, such as the Family History Library, should show a call number of 
the source at that repository. The call number of that source should be 
recorded using a subordinate CALN tag.  Systems which do not structure a 
repository name and address interface should store the information about where 
the source record is stored in the <<NOTE_STRUCTURE>> of this structure.
