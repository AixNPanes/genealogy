The name value is formed in the manner the name is normally spoken, with the 
given name and family name (surname) separated by slashes (/). (See 
<NAME_PERSONAL>, page 50.) Based on the dynamic nature or unknown compositions 
of naming conventions, it is difficult to provide more detailed name piece 
structure to handle every case. The NPFX, GIVN, NICK, SPFX, SURN, and NSFX 
tags are provided optionally for systems that cannot operate effectively with 
less structured information.  For current future compatibility, all systems 
must construct their names based on the <NAME_PERSONAL> structure. Those using 
the optional name pieces should assume that few systems will process them, and 
most will not provide the name pieces. Future GEDCOM releases (6.0 and later) 
will likely apply a very different strategy to resolve this problem, possibly 
using a sophisticated parser and a name-knowledge database.
