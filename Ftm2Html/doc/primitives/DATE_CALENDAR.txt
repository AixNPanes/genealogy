DATE_CALENDAR:=	{Size=4:35} 
[ <DATE_GREG> | <DATE_JULN> | <DATE_HEBR> | <DATE_FREN> |  <DATE_FUTURE> ]

The selection is based on the <DATE_CALENDAR_ESCAPE> that precedes the 
<DATE_CALENDAR> value immediately to the left.  If <DATE_CALENDAR_ESCAPE> 
doesn't appear at this point, then @#DGREGORIAN@ is assumed.  No future 
calendar types will use words (e.g., month names) from this list: FROM, 
TO, BEF, AFT, BET, AND, ABT, EST, CAL, or INT. When only a day and month 
appears as a DATE value it is considered a date phrase and not a valid date 
form.

The date escape determines the date interpretation by signifying which 
<DATE_CALENDAR> to use.

The default calendar is the Gregorian calendar.
