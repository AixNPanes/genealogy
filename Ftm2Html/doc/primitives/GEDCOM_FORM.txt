GEDCOM_FORM:=	{Size=14:20} 
[ LINEAGE-LINKED ] 

The GEDCOM form used to construct this transmission. There maybe other forms 
used such as CommSoft's "EVENT_LINEAGE_LINKED" but these specifications define 
only the LINEAGELINKED Form.  Systems will use this value to specify GEDCOM 
compatible with these specifications.
