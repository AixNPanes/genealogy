DATE_LDS_ORD:=	{Size=4:35} 
<DATE_VALUE> 

LDS ordinance dates use only the Gregorian date and most often use the form 
of day, month, and year.

Only in rare instances is there a partial date. The temple tag and code should 
always accompany temple ordinance dates. Sometimes the 
LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS is used to indicate that an ordinance date and 
temple code is not required, such as when BIC is used. 
(See LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS definitions beginning on page 48.)
