DATE_RANGE:=	{Size=8:35} 
[ BEF <DATE> | AFT <DATE> | BET <DATE> AND <DATE> ]

Where:

AFT = Event happened after the given date.
BEF = Event happened before the given date.
BET = Event happened some time between date 1 AND date 2. 

For example, bet 1904 and 1915 indicates that the event state 
(perhaps a single day) existed somewhere between 1904 and 1915 inclusive.

The date range differs from the date period in that the date range is an 
estimate that an event happened on a single date somewhere in the date range 
specified.

The following are equivalent and interchangeable:
Short form	Long Form 
---------—	---------—
1852		BET 1 JAN 1852 AND 31 DEC 1852
1852		BET 1 JAN 1852 AND DEC 1852

1852		BET JAN 1852 AND DEC 1852 
JAN 1920	BET 1 JAN 1920 AND 31 JAN 1920
