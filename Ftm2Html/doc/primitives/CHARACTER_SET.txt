CHARACTER_SET:=	{Size=1:8}
[ ANSEL | UNICODE | ASCII ] 

A code value that represents the character set to be used to interpret 
this data. The default character set is ANSEL, which includes ASCII as a 
subset. UNICODE is not widely supported by most operating systems; therefore, 
GEDCOM produced using the UNICODE character set will be limited in acceptance 
for some time. See Chapter 3, starting on page 65. ASCII contains the character 
set from 0x0 to 0xFF.

Note:The IBMPC character set is not allowed. This character set cannot be 
interpreted properly without knowing which code page the sender was using.
