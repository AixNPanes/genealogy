* NOTE:
Submissions to the Family History Department for Ancestral File submission or 
for clearing temple ordinances  must use a DESTination of ANSTFILE or 
TempleReady.  

The header structure provides information about the entire transmission. The 
SOURce system name identifies which system sent the data. The DESTination 
system name identifies the intended receiving system.

Additional GEDCOM standards will be produced in the future to reflect GEDCOM
expansion and maturity. This requires the reading program to make sure it can
read the GEDC.VERS and the GEDC.FORM values to insure proper readability. The 
CHAR tag is required. All character codes greater than 0x7F must be converted
to ANSEL. (See Chapter 3, starting on page 65.)
