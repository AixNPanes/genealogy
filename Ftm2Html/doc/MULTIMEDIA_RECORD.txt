Large whole multimedia objects embedded in a GEDCOM file would break some 
systems.  For this purpose, large multimedia files should be divided into 
smaller multimedia records by using the subordinate OBJE tag to chain to the 
next <MULTIMEDIA_RECORD> fragment.  This will allow GEDCOM records to be 
maintained below the 32K limit for use in systems with limited resources.
