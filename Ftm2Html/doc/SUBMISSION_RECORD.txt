The sending system uses a submission record to send instructions and 
information to the receiving system. TempleReady processes submission records 
to determine which temple the cleared records should be directed to. The 
submission record is also used for communication between Ancestral File 
download requests and TempleReady. Each GEDCOM transmission file should have 
only one submission record. Multiple submissions are handled by creating 
separate GEDCOM transmission files.
